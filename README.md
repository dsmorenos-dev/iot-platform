# iot-platform
# IoT Full-Stack Platform

A complete full-stack IoT platform designed to demonstrate skills in  
**web development, backend engineering, databases, Python, C++ (ESP-IDF/PlatformIO), and scalable system architecture**.

This project serves as both a **personal portfolio** and a **foundation for a production-ready IoT ecosystem**.

---

## 🚀 Project Goal

Build a modular, extensible IoT platform where:

- **ESP32 devices** collect sensor data and execute remote commands  
- A **Python backend (FastAPI)** exposes APIs, handles authentication, and manages devices  
- A **frontend dashboard** visualizes data in real time  
- **Microservices** process telemetry, send alerts, and perform automation  
- Everything can be deployed via containers and scaled for production

> This repository acts as a technical showcase and a long-term IoT development environment.
